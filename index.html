            <h1>Why do we advocate for animals?</h1>
            <p>We are all animals. The other animals who share the planet with us are sentient; like us, they feel pain, they feel pleasure, and they experience the world subjectively. They are individuals who matter. Despite this, a staggering number of animals are forced to endure significant cruelty and abuse. It is estimated that between 1-3 trillion animals are slaughtered each year for human consumption alone. Seeing that they cannot speak up for themselves, they rely on us to speak up and advocate on their behalf.</p>
            <p id="read-more-why" style="display: none;">
                Animals, like us, are sentient individuals; we feel pleasure, we feel pain, and we experience life in our own way. For those of us who have pets or who have spent time with animals, we can say from personal experience that animals have distinct personalities; they have preferences and desires, as well as their own unique quirks. 
                Many people consider themselves as animal lovers, and feel a deep emotional connection to other animals. Even for those who don't go so far as to claim they love animals, most are against hurting an animal for no reason. Animals matter to all of us in some way; even if they don't matter enough to you to deserve your love, they matter enough to at least not be needlessly harmed.
                Given that animals do matter to us, it is important for us all to be aware of the fact that animals are forced to endure unimaginable cruelty and abuse. It is estimated that between 1-3 trillion animals are slaughtered each year for human consumption alone. 
                Moreover, this statistic does not reflect the abuse that animals endure before slaughter, while they are alive. These animals endure forced confinement, forceful impregnation, bodily mutilations, mass suffocation, separation from their children, and more.
                It's easy to get lost in the numbers, but think about that for a second: that is trillions of different individuals, each with their own unique experience of life, being abused and having their lives cut short each year.
                Sadly, these animals cannot advocate for themselves. They are often hidden away in slaughterhouses and on farms, far from public view, where their suffering goes unnoticed. 
                They are vulnerable and helpless, and they rely on us to speak for them. We may not know what it's exactly like to be a chicken, cow, or pig, but we share with them the capacity to suffer and the desire to have autonomy over our body. This is enough for us to be able to empathize with them. If we were in the animal's position, being abused with no way to defend ourselves, then we would desperately hope that others would come to our defense.
                We advocate for animals because we would want someone speaking up for us if we were as vulnerable as them. We advocate for animals because they get only one life, just like we do, and they deserve to spend their limited time on Earth free from suffering and abuse.</p>
